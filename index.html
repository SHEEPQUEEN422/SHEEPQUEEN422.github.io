       <h2>RESEARCH EXPERIENCE</h2>
      <h3>National Natural Science Foundation of China (Major Program) - Research on Disaster Culture and Resilient Society Construction from the Perspective of Public Health Security</h3>
      <p>- To understand the impact of the Shanghai lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic on frontline service workers and to propose corresponding policy improvements, we conducted interviews with SF Express couriers, Meituan delivery drivers, and Dingdong Maicai couriers who experienced the pandemic's effects. The study involved three months of fieldwork and interviews, engaging with subjects face-to-face or over the phone.<br>                                  
- During this grassroots research, I conducted in-depth interviews with 15 participants, resulting in approximately 1,200 minutes of recorded interviews. The collected data was coded and summarized, providing valuable data analysis materials specific to certain areas of Shanghai for the project team.</p>
      <h3>City-level Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project Achievement: Environmental Intelligent Streetlamp Equipped with FMCW Radar</h3>
      <p>- Participating in a sustainable development innovation and entrepreneurship project, we integrated frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar technology with streetlights to achieve intelligent lighting control, thereby reducing the waste and energy consumption of urban streetlights.<br> 
- Collaborating with five other students from different colleges, we simulated a startup company and conducted a comprehensive evaluation, including the company profile, value assessment, risk assessment, SWOT analysis, product introduction, sales and public relations strategies, and financial planning.</p>
